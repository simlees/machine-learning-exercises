SUPERVISED - data has labels / class (e.g. contains face)
  - regression
  - SVMs
  - neural networks
UNSUPERVISED - data has no labels
  - clustering
  - anomaly detection
  - association rule detection (finding relationships between features)
SEMISUPERVISED - usually a combination of two approaches
REINFORCEMENT - an AGENT carries out actions which will REWARD or PENALISE. These results form/reinforce the POLICY

BATCH LEARNING - learning carried out in one block. Needs to be retrained from scratch if changed
ONLINE LEARNING - can be taught incrementally with chunks of data. Can have a high learning rate (low inertia) or
                  low. High is more adaptable but forgets faster


ATTRIBUTE - data type or column
FEATURE - attribute and respective value. Attribute/feature can be used interchangeably
CLASS - label (positive / negative)
CLASSIFICATION - determining class of data (supervised learning task)
LABEL - output or what you're attempting to predict
LABELLED - data that is described, eg photo contains dog
DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION - removing unneeded features / combining highly correlated features (age / mileage)
UNLABELLED - data without meta information
OVERFITTING - training and validating model with same data (very bad)
