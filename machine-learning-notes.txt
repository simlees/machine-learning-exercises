More complex and unsupervised algorithms can be good at discerning relationships between datasets

Labelled - Data that is described, eg this photo contains a person
Unlabelled - Data without any 'meta information' eg photograph, newspaper etc

With ML, can't work with NaN / patchy data. Replacing with extreme value means it's treated as an outlier
